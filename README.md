# Options Trading Bot

This project is an options trading bot that uses advanced models and techniques to make profitable trades in both low and high volatility markets. The bot is designed to be flexible, efficient, and easy to deploy and maintain.

## Features

- **Low Volatility Trading**: For low volatility markets, the bot utilizes the Barone-Adesi and Whaley (BAW) model, a popular and effective approach for pricing American options.

- **High Volatility Trading**: In high volatility market conditions, the bot employs Monte Carlo simulations to estimate option prices and make trading decisions more accurately.

- **Backtesting Engine**: A powerful backtesting engine is included, allowing you to evaluate the performance of your trading strategies on historical market data before deploying them in live markets.

- **Risk Management**: The bot calculates and provides essential Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, and Rho) for effective risk management and position adjustment.

- **Docker Containerization**: The entire project can be packaged and deployed as a Docker container, ensuring consistent and reproducible behavior across different environments.
